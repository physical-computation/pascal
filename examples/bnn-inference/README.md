# Simple Bayesian Neural Network Example

## Key outcome
This example compares the use of Pascal and Pytorch to write a simple Bayesian Neural Network that is trained using [variational inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424).


The PyTorch code was obtained from [saxena-mayur/Weight-Uncertainty-in-Neural-Networks](https://github.com/saxena-mayur/Weight-Uncertainty-in-Neural-Networks).
## Usage
To run this example, run the following from the root directory of this project:
```
make eg-bnn-simple
```

Then look inside `examples/bnn-simple/plots/` for the plots generated by Pascal and PyTorch. They should look exactly the same.
